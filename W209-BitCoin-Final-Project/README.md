## Final Project
Working in a group of three or four people, you will design and develop an interactive visualization with some supporting text for viewing online.
You may use any dataset you like. Final deliverables are (1) an in-class demonstration and (2) a web site with the online, interactive visualization that demonstrates your design.

Your final project web site will be hosted on the I School webspace, for interacting with the webspace see instructions here. The website can include embedded Tableau and Observable visualizations.

## Final Project Proposal
Please prepare a very short (no more than 1 or 2 pages), informal summary of what you plan to do as a group, and upload or email it to your instructor by the week six live session. Address the following in your write-up. This will not be a graded assignment, but it is important for keeping your project group on track. Your instructor will give feedback, and they may ask you to change your scope if they think it's too much or too little for this class.

Names of students in your group \
What is your project concept? \
Who are your users? \
What are some tasks they will do with your visualization? \
What is an example of an insight that you hope your work will show? \
Where will you get your data?

## Final Project Exploratory Visualization
In this assignment you will be using your final project dataset and exploring it with your tool of choice from the course (d3/vegalite/altair/Tableau). Begin by inspecting the available data without visualizing the data, and write down three hypotheses. Next, investigate each of your hypotheses by visualizing relevant variables (including derived variables, if that helps) in multiple ways. Look for correlations, clusters, outliers, or any other patterns. See if you can find evidence for or against each hypothesis. As you explore, retain multiple sheets in your workbook that show the development of your analysis. Try to find something unexpected in the data. For only one of the hypotheses, describe your exploration process, noting changes and refinements you made to the visualizations as you went along, as well as what worked or didn’t work during your exploration process. We expect to see at least three steps in this refinement process. For the remaining two hypotheses, list each hypothesis and conclusion, provide the beginning and final visualization.

Note: this assignment will be graded primarily on how thoroughly you explored the data set with various visualizations. Your first and last visualizations should be quite different.

## Rubric

Good judgment in the analysis of the representations tried: 20 points
Experimentation with a variety of chart types: 15 points
Refinement within individual chart types: 15 points
Applying information gained in one visualization to enhance another: 10 points
Clear and reasonable hypotheses: 10 points
Reasonable conclusion for each hypothesis: 10 points
Describing the work in enough detail to follow it: 10 points
Clear and readable writing: 10 points
Example submission
TBD, ask your instructor.

## Mid-Term Presentations
You will give a 15-minute presentation showing your prototype thus far during live session. At this point, you should have some form of prototype that can demonstrate the interactions. You might do this with Keynote or PowerPoint, for example. You may use a static drawing program if you can explain the interaction thoroughly. You can show your work in code if you like, but it's not required at this stage. You should show several iterations of designs that your group has considered and explain why you made the choices you made to get the current design. You should also explain how you plan to test your design. All team members must participate in the presentation. Please include an email address at the end of your presentation for your peers to offer additional feedback.

## Final Project Usability Study
In this individual assignment, you will conduct a usability test with the current prototype of your final project with at least three test subjects. You may use a paper prototype if necessary, but it’s best to use a live, interactive one. Although this is an individual assignment, you should work with other members of your group to develop the set of test tasks and questions. When your testing is complete, you will turn in a prioritized list of your own findings for this assignment. Your group will then create a master prioritized list for the project itself, to be discussed during your final project presentation. You should review the usability testing materials from the course content before doing this assignment.

## Steps to guide the assignment are below.

Develop a Task List. Working with the rest of your team, develop a set of test tasks with good coverage of the content and interactions in your prototype. Make sure your task instructions are specific. (There are some great pointers here: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/.) Include a few debriefing questions at the end as well.

Schedule Participants: Arrange to meet with your test subjects either in real life or virtually. (If using a paper prototype, this must be in real life.) Plan for approximately 30 minutes per session.

Record the Session: Make an audio or audio/video recording of each session. Remember to focus on observing rather than interviewing. You want to see what the user can do without your help, not ask them how they would design the visualization. Limit yourself to making brief, if any, notes during the testing session.

Write Up Notes: Make more complete notes after reviewing the recordings (best to do within 24 hours of a test). Your notes should reflect what you observed about the user’s behavior with the prototype. Where did they make errors? Where did they go off track? What do you believe caused them to do so?

Make a Prioritized List: From your notes, make a prioritized list of issues to be addressed, along with suggested solutions. Use MoSCoW prioritization.

Turn in a list of your group’s test tasks and questions, your notes on the tests, and your prioritized list of issues and changes. We will be looking for appropriateness of test tasks and debriefing questions, thoroughness, attention to what each user does, accurate prioritization, and strong correlation between observations and suggestions for improvement.

## Final Project Presentation and Report
You will give a demonstration of your visualization in action for your classmates during the discussion section. Like the mid-term presentations, you will have 15 minutes. This demonstration is your chance to show your fellow students how far your design has come since the mid-term milestone. Tell us what you changed and why. You must include details and conclusions from at least one round of usability testing (with at least three different subjects).Tell how your design changed in response to your findings. Also address your choice of tools for building the final interactive visualization. All team members must participate in the presentation.

## Project Web Report & Video
One team member must submit the URL for the final version of the project web site and a breakdown of which group members undertook which tasks through the ISVC. Include any additional information you would like your instructor to be aware of, changes you would have made if you had more time, such as information you didn't have time to include in the final presentation. Include a link to a 2-3 minute video demo of the visulization posted to YouTube (this serves to memorialize the project to share with future classes - and you can share this for your own portfolio).

The project web site itself must include (a) an interactive visualization, and (b) explanatory text to accompany the interactive visualization. Text should include the names of team members, the visualization’s goals, its intended audience, and the data source(s). This may be included as an About page or integrated with the visualization itself, as appropriate. Use the I School web servers for the final project; see instructions for using your I School web site. Each group is expected to share a description, link, and screencapture image of their project through the I School Projects page for posterity: https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/node/add/stpr. Please do select the course and section. Students who use Amazon or another service that will not remain live are expected to make a video walkthrough of the site and to include this in their post.

## Grading for Final Projects
Your instructor will consider the final presentations, the web site, and any additional information you provide in the final paper in determining a single grade for the final project.

12 points - Is the final product of appropriate form? \
12 points - Does it successfully solve a problem or inform the user? \
12 points - Is the explanatory text clear? \
12 points - Did you show substantial iteration? \
10 points - Can the visualization be understood without too much effort? \
10 points - Is it aesthetically pleasing? \
10 points - Did you include results of usability testing? \
8 points - Did you present data in a novel way? \
8 points - Did you explain your choice of tools? \
6 points - Did everyone in your group participate?
